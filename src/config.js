/**
 * This application is configured via environment variables. In this module, we
 * load and export them for easy use elsewhere!
 *
 * Locally, you can use a `.env` file to specify these values - or, if you
 * deploy to a service like Heroku, you can specify them in your application's
 * "config vars" control panel.
 *
 * Some of these values are simple:
 *
 * - `DISCORD_CLIENT_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot's secret login token.
 * - `MIRROR_SERVER_ID`: The Discord server ID for your "mirror server", your
 *   private command-center server just for this bot. In the web app, this is
 *   the first big number in the server's URL.
 *
 * The values for specifying your set of source servers and plural identities
 * are a bit more complex, because you can have more than one of each. In each
 * case, replace `{shortcode}` with an alphanumeric "shortcode" for the server
 * or identity. Note the double underscores around shortcodes.
 *
 * - `SOURCE_SERVERS__{shortcode}__SERVER_ID`: The Discord server ID for this
 *   "source server", a public-ish server where the canonical conversations
 *   happen. In the web app, this is the first big number in the server's URL.
 * - `IDENTITIES__{shortcode}__NAME`: The display name for this plural
 *   identity. Will appear on each message this headmate sends. (This can use
 *   cute Unicode or emoji or whatever - in the app, you'll always this
 *   identity by its shortcode anyway, so it's okay if this string is fancy and
 *   hard to type!)
 * - `IDENTITIES__{shortcode}__AVATAR_URL`: The avatar URL for this plural
 *   identity. Will appear as the avatar for each message this headmate sends.
 *   (If you want to use a file from your computer, consider uploading it to
 *   imgur and copying the .png URL to here!)
 *
 * For your source server, the "shortcode" will be used when creating mirror
 * channels. For example, if you have `SOURCE_SERVERS__test__SERVER_ID`
 * configured, and the corresponding source server has a #general channel, then
 * we'll create a #test-general channel in your mirror server. This enables you
 * to mirror channels from multiple servers, without worrying about naming
 * conflicts.
 *
 * For your identities, the "shortcode" will be used to type messages as this
 * identity. For example, if you have `IDENTITIES__e__NAME` configured, then
 * you can type "e Hello!" in a mirror channel, it will send a message as
 * identity "e".
